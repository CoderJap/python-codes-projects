# properties of sets
# -> sets are unordered
# -> sets are unindexed 
# -> there is no way to change items in sets 
# -> sets cannot contain duplicate values

# operations on sets 
# len(s) - returns length of set
# s.remove(8) - updates the sets and removes 8 from s 
# s.pop() - removes an random element from the set and returns the element removed 
# s.clear() - empties the set
# also union and intersection etc
