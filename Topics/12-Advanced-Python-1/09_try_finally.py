try:
  #Somecode
  pass
except:
  #Somecode
  pass

finally:
  #Somecode  #This is executed humesha 
  pass


# use of finally - when this piece of code is written in a function and lets say try and except code returns something now if we would have written normal print statement instead of fianlly then it wouldn't have been executed because ek baar return call hogya func mei toh uske neeche wale statements nhi chalte but in case of finally it will still execute, this is why we use finally as kuch bhi rule ho but finally toh chalega hi chalega!!
